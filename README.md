# TechLabs Aachen Journey
# Instructions for Downloading and Completing the Exercises

## Getting Started

- **Git Clone**: You can use Git to clone the repository if you are familiar with it.
- **Download ZIP**:
  - Alternatively, download everything as a ZIP file by clicking the **BIG GREEN BUTTON** labeled "Code" and then selecting "Download Zip".

**ATTENTION**: You should download and execute the exercises on your PC. If you are trying to solve the exercises by editing stuff directly on the GitHub page, you are doing something wrong!

## Python Exercises

- There are **4 Python Exercises** which are mandatory for all Data Science and Deep Learning Techies.
- By solving all 4 exercises, you pass to the project phase!
- In each directory, there is a `README.md` that describes the exercise.
- **Recommended Order**:
  1. `fizzbuzz`
  2. `strings (galactic food)`
  3. `outliers`
  4. `ads prediction`

## Web Exercises

- There are **4 Web Exercises**, all of which are mandatory for all Web Dev Techies, regardless of whether you chose backend or frontend.
- You can choose any 4 exercises to pass to the projects phase (no specific requirement here).
- In each directory, there is a `README.md` that describes the exercise.
- **Recommended Order**:
  1. `hellofresh`
  2. `js_leetcode`
  3. `react-todo`
  4. (a backend exercise) `aviato-backend`

## How the Exercises Work

- Solve the exercises. For a correct solution, you will receive a gibberish string (like `fX59aXdqZEFeXXFAeUwJJAVk`). This is the key :key: that you must hand in!
- The task will ask you to enter your email address, or you will have to place your email address somewhere in the code (at the appropriate place as described in the task). Please use the email you used to register for the tracks (Survey from the kick-off event). We use this email to derive your Key.
- Each Techie has a unique set of keys but the same tasks! Feel free to collaborate :tada:
