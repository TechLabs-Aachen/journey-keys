# Fizzbuzz


One on the very first programming exercises is the fizzbuzz problem. It's a quite 
simple problem so I'm convinced that you can solve it. 

You are given a number `n` and you have to print the numbers from 1 to `n` (including). But
instead of printing the number you have to print `Fizz` if the number is
divisible by 3, `Buzz` if the the number is divisible by 5 and `FizzBuzz` if
the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

Easy right?

You will find the file `task.py` in this directory. You should implement the 
`fizzbuzz` function in that file. 


We check your solution from your `print()` statements. So, don't use any extra `print()`
besides what is needed for the solution. 

**As always, if you struggle with the problem, ask for help in Slack or join one of our 
co-working sessions throughout the track phase!**
