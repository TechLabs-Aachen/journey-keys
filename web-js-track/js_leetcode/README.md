# JS Leetcode

Welcome to the JS Leetcode exercise! In the `index.js` you will find four functions 
that should be implemented. The functions are:

- `function filter(arr, filter_out)` 
- `function swapObjectKeyValue(obj)`
- `function mergeObject(obj1, obj2)`
- `function sortTriplets(triplets)` 

The goal of these functions is explained in the `index.js` file as comments! Implement 
them and run the `index.js` file to get your key. You will be prompted to enter your 
email if the tests are passed.

Happy coding!
